**Unit 10: 1989 – Nonviolence and the End of The Cold War** <span
id="10"></span> 
*In the mid 1980s, the Soviet Union underwent extensive political and
economic reforms known as Glasnost and Perestroika. During this time,
democracy advocates in many East European nations within the Soviet Bloc
began to openly challenge communist authorities and communist rule. The
governments initially attempted to suppress this opposition, but many
gradually recognized the futility of the effort.  In 1989, a series of
mostly non-violent revolutions swept the Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern
Europe and effectively ended communist rule in these countries.
Provisional democratic governments took control and began making
arrangements for free and open elections.  Meanwhile, in the summer of
1989, Chinese democracy advocates, inspired by the revolutions in
Eastern Europe, staged a major protest in Tiananmen Square. The Chinese
government eventually used police and military forces to violently put
down the democracy movement and reestablish firm communist control of
the nation. For the Soviet Union, the Eastern European revolutions of
1989 led to a gradual thawing of relations with the West.  In 1991,
conservative communist officials in Russia attempted to stage a coup and
regain control of the state. The people of Moscow successfully resisted
their efforts, but the coup attempt revealed the declining power of the
party. In December of 1991, the Soviet Union was officially disbanded
and Russia’s long experiment with Communism came to an end.  
*  
 *In this unit, you will examine the factors that led to successful
democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and analyze the broader social
and cultural changes that came about in Eastern Europe and Russia after
1989.*
