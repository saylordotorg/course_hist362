**Unit 6: Revolutionary Mexico and the Legacies of Colonialism** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In many ways, the Mexican Revolution of 1910 represented the
culmination of a century of political and social conflict in Latin and
South America, following independence from Spanish and Portuguese
colonial rule. While Mexico had ostensibly become a democracy after it
separated from Spain, the nation’s political, economic, and social
institutions were dominated by wealthy elites. Lower and middle-class
Mexicans had little political power and constantly faced oppression by
corrupt landlords and political officials. The Mexican Revolution
initially began as an upper-middle-class political conflict between the
nation’s long-time president, Porfirio Diaz, and political challenger
Francisco Madero, but it gradually expanded to encompass all classes of
Mexican society. The conflict eventually led to Diaz’s fall from power,
but a series of coups and counter-coups prevented the return of stable
government. Poor farmers and indigenous peoples also took advantage of
revolutionary chaos to challenge the political and economic power of
wealthy landlords and local officials.  Political and social order was
gradually restored to Mexico by the early 1930s, after Mexico’s new
president Lazaro Cardenas implemented a number of social reforms
designed to address some of the extreme social and economic inequalities
in the nation. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will analyze the origins of the Mexican Revolution
and examine how it affected all aspects of Mexican society. You will
also explore the broader consequences of the revolution for the people
and political institutions of Mexico, Latin America, and South America.*
