**Unit 9: Revolution and Religion - The Islamic Republic of Iran** <span
id="9"></span> 
*Iran’s Islamic Revolution of 1978-1979 shared similarities with other
20th century revolutions, but religion played a central role in the
revolutionary events. In the late 1970s, a broad coalition of religious
leaders, students, workers, and middle-class Iranians challenged the
political power of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s secular,
autocratic leader. A series of strikes and demonstrations in 1978 forced
the Shah to flee Iran. Following his departure, Iran’s theocratic
leaders appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as the new supreme
religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Khomeini consolidated
power by arresting and persecuting members of the secular political
groups that had initially supported the revolution. As with the Shah,
Khomeini did not tolerate political or social dissent. He used state
institutions to eliminate dissent and impose a fundamentalist,
socio-religious political system on the nation.   
*  
 *In this unit, you will study the creation of the Islamic Republic of
Iran and compare the Iranian Revolution with earlier revolutions in the
United States, France, Mexico, and Russia.*
