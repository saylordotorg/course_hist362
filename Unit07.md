**Unit 7: Revolutionary Russia – Marxist Theory and Agrarian Realities**
<span id="7"></span> 
*The revolutions of 1905 and 1917 reshaped Russia’s political
institutions and led to nearly a century of conflict with the West.
During the 1905 revolution, Russian liberals challenged the absolute
authority of the Russian tsar. A broad revolutionary coalition of
workers and middle-class Russians used economic and political means to
demand democratic concessions from the Russian state. While these gains
were temporary, they served as an inspiration for later revolutionaries.
At the height of World War One in 1917, a coalition of Russian liberals
and socialists once again challenged Russia’s autocratic government.
Through a series of general strikes and political protests in February
of 1917, they forced the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II.  Liberal
leaders established a weak provisional national government, while
socialist officials organized local soviets, or political councils, of
workers in Russia’s industrial communities. These political bodies soon
came into conflict. By October of 1917, the Bolshevik Party, a Communist
organization under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, staged a revolution
against the provisional government and seized control of the state. The
Bolsheviks used military force to consolidate power and establish
control over local soviets.  Throughout the 1920s, Lenin and his
successor Joseph Stalin imposed Communism on Russia’s political,
economic, and social institutions. Communist leaders also attempted to
export the revolution to the West by supporting Communist political
organizations in Europe and the United States.   
*  
 *In this unit, you will study the Russian Revolution and examine
connections and conflicts between Marxist theory and events that took
place in 1917. You will make comparisons between the Russian Revolution
and other revolutions you studied in earlier units, and examine the
global impact of the Communist Revolution in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.   *
