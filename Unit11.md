**Unit 11: Revolutions in Perspective** <span id="11"></span> 
*This unit provides a critical overview of the revolutions examined in
this course. It returns to broad questions about revolutions and
contemporary realities: how have revolutions shaped the modern world? Is
violence a necessary component of revolutionary change? What are the
connections between revolutionary ideas and revolutionary action? Are
deteriorating economic conditions the most important cause of
revolutionary unrest or can other factors take precedence? Approaching
the material in this unit with these questions in mind will help you
trace the commonalities, differences, and linkages among modern
revolutionary movements. By studying the historiographical essays and
analyses included in this unit, you will also return to the problem of
identifying useful theoretical models of revolutionary change and
confronting these with existing historical evidence. Finally, you will
identify and analyze ways in which contemporary politics throughout the
world still show traces of revolutionary legacies. *
