**Unit 2: Revolutions and Modernity** <span id="2"></span> 
**It is a commonplace among historians that the ‘modern age’ began with
the French Revolution.  Though there were revolutions in the ancient
world, many argue that something radically new appeared in history at
the end of the eighteenth century.  In this unit, you will explore the
connection between revolutions and modernity by focusing on the
following questions:  What was the western world like before modernity? 
What ideas inspired the French Revolution, and what was modern about
them?  Your analysis of pre-revolutionary Europe will also give you a
point of comparison for later units, which turn to non-western
revolutions.**
