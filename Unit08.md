**Unit 8: Two Revolutions in China - Liberalism and Marxism in a New
Context** <span id="8"></span> 
*In the twentieth century, China experienced two revolutions which
dramatically reshaped its social and political institutions. In 1911,
nationalist forces overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established a
republican government. The experiment with democracy did not last long
and the nation soon fell into anarchy. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s,
the revolutionary Chinese Communist Party battled Chinese Nationalists
for political control over major regions of the country. Both sides
agreed to a truce in order to respond to the Japanese invasion of China
in the late 1930s, but the Communists and the Nationalists resumed their
civil war following the end of the Second World War in 1945. In 1949,
Mao Zedong’s communist forces defeated the Nationalist forces and
established a communist government in China. Communist policies resulted
in large-scale land reforms and the government instituted dramatic
industrial development initiatives. While these policies contributed to
China’s remarkable economic development, they also resulted in the
suffering and death of millions of Chinese citizens. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will investigate how China’s 20th-century
revolutions altered the nation politically, economically, and socially.
You will also evaluate the international consequences of these
revolutions and their broader implications for global history.*
