**Unit 5: The French Revolution and the Birth of Modernity** <span
id="5"></span> 
**The French Revolution was perhaps the most important of modern
revolutions. In this unit, you will analyze its causes, dynamics,
ideologies, and legacies. During the course of the revolution, its
leaders abolished the monarchy and altered most of France’s social and
political institutions in order to make them more rational and more
modern. They proclaimed a republic, instituted parliamentary elections,
introduced educational reforms, created a new revolutionary calendar,
and reorganized France’s electoral districts to make representation more
democratic. The revolution, however, turned sharply away from its
initial ideals when the new government began to use violence and terror
to maintain its hold on power. By 1799 the revolution succumbed to
Napoleon’s dictatorship. In what follows, you will examine the ideas
that inspired the revolutionaries, the logic of revolutionary idealism
and violence, and the relationship between Napoleon and the Revolution.
You will also consider ways in which the struggle that started in France
in 1789 continued in Europe in the 1830s, 40s, and 70s.**

     Instructions: Please watch the above video (approx. 17 minutes).
     The French Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the
    Estates-General—a general assembly representing the three French
    estates of the realm: the nobility, the church, and the common
    people.  Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his
    government's financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several
    weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse as the three
    estates clashed over their respective powers.  It was brought to an
    end when many members of the Third Estate formed themselves into a
    National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.   On
    July 14 of that same year, the Bastille—a medieval fortress and
    prison which represented royal authority in the center of Paris—was
    stormed by a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored there.
