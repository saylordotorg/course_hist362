**Unit 4: The American Revolution - Ideas and Experience** <span
id="4"></span> 
*By the middle of the eighteenth century, Britain had colonies and
trading posts throughout the world. It emerged victorious from the Seven
Years’ War (1756-1763), but the war pushed it to impose new taxes on the
American Colonies. This, in turn, provoked the colonists’ resistance,
which eventually led to revolution and the creation of the United
States. With time, the initially limited goals of greater local control
over trade and taxes were replaced by calls for independence and
creation of democratic institutions which would help govern the new
nation. The American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) brought about
complete separation from Britain, but there was no consensus regarding
the institutions and values which should structure the newly independent
state. As the Revolution proceeded, its leaders debated the nature of
freedom and government, the best ways of structuring the state, the
proper relationship between religion and politics, and other
fundamentally important topics. Their views about all of these issues
often reflected their fundamental beliefs and assumptions about human
nature. In this unit, you will explore the American revolutionary
experience, the creation of the United States, and the most important
ideas and ideals which helped shape this time of rapid political and
social transformation.*
