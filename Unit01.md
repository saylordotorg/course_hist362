**Unit 1: What is a Revolution?** <span id="1"></span> 
**This unit will seek to answer the seemingly basic question: what is a
revolution? Historians have debated this question since the great
political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.  Most scholars
will agree that dramatic transformations of political systems of a
nation, often accompanied by violence, qualify as a revolution, but few
agree about the fundamental factors that cause revolutions.  In this
unit, you will examine various types of revolutions and evaluate
theoretical models that seek to explain the causes and consequences of
revolutions.  You will consider how such theoretical models help to make
sense of history and how they sometimes hinder understanding.**

     Instructions: This course and Professor O’Brien’s lecture to which
    you listened in sub-subunit 1.2.1 focus primarily on political
    revolutions, but it is important to be aware that there are other
    types of revolutionary change. There was, for example, the
    “Scientific Revolution,” the “Industrial Revolution,” the so-called
    “Revolt against positivism,” in Europe’s arts and philosophy at the
    end of the nineteenth century, and we are now in the midst of what
    many call the “Environmental Revolution,” or intensified efforts to
    make economic growth sustainable. The reading in this sub-subunit is
    a brief conceptual definition of the Scientific Revolution. Please
    read this text in its entirety, focusing on any similarities you
    perceive between political and scientific revolutionary change.  
      
     This reading will take you approximately 15 minutes to complete.

    on the ways in which the Industrial Revolution changed the lives of

    Merriman uses the plural concept of “revolutions” rather than a
    single “revolution” to characterize this period?  Please write a
    brief paragraph to answer this question.

     Instructions: Watch the second part of this lecture (minute 34 to
    the end), and focus on understanding the competing analytical models
    historians have used to explain revolutionary change. Professor
    O’Brien discusses several models which make connections between
    revolutions and the following factors: Marxist theory, political
    centralization, modernization, intellectuals, and the international
    context. As you listen to the lecture, make sure you can discuss
    each of these, and identify the most important theorist associated
    with each approach.  More broadly, consider the following questions:
    what are the advantages of building conceptual models to
    characterize revolutions? What are the drawbacks of using conceptual
    models to understand history?

     Instructions: Please read the entire article. Rejaee presents a
    short review of political theorist Hannah Arendt’s book *On
    Revolution*.  In this book, Arendt argues that political revolutions
    are a necessary part of fostering liberty and a sense of freedom and
    equality in modern societies. Rajaee critiques Arendt’s ideas and
    asserts that she fails to account for non-altruistic motivations in
    her arguments about the origins and causes of revolutions.  What do
    you think are the most important factors that motivate individuals
    to participate in revolutionary events?
