**Unit 3: Seventeenth-Century England - Revolution or Civil War?** <span
id="3"></span> 
**In this unit, you will study the English Revolution, or rather several
waves of revolutionary events between 1640 and 1688, events which became
an important inspiration for Enlightenment thinkers and for
revolutionaries in America and France. The English Revolution was,
however, an incomplete one in that it established a constitutional
monarchy and not a republic. You will analyze the differences between
civil war and revolution, the political and symbolic significance of
beheading the king, and the hugely influential documents produced by the
English revolutionaries.**
